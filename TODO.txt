Stuff I've noticed.

`ls -a` doesn't work
exiting rush results in a weird broken shell. and exiting that crashes
u-root -files needs docs for src:dst
u-root -files needs a -verbose to see what its doing
u-root -files doesn't seem to work for /usr - in fact /usr seems pretty busted
u-root -files or similar could do with "add all files from this dir recursively"
